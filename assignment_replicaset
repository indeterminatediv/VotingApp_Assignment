Common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set:

A common use-case for using a DaemonSet instead of a ReplicaSet is when you need to ensure that a specific type of pod runs on every node in your Kubernetes cluster. 
For example, you might use a DaemonSet to deploy a logging agent or monitoring agent that collects logs or metrics from each node in the cluster.
This way, every node will always have one instance of the agent running, regardless of how many nodes are in the cluster.
